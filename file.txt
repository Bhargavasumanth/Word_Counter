Visakhapatnam's history dates back to the 6th century BCE. It was ruled by the Andhra Satavahanas, Vengi, the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties.
Visakhapatnam was an ancient Port city which had trade relations with the Middle East and Rome. 
Ships were anchored at open roads and were loaded with cargo transported from Visakhapatnam shore using small Masula boats. 
A reference to Vizagapatnam merchant is available in the inscriptions of Bheemeswara temple of East Godavari District. 
During the 12th century CE, Vizagapatnam was a fortified merchandise town managed by a guild.
European powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under French colonial rule.
Control passed to the East India Company in 1804 and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947.
